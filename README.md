# Global_Depression_Report

This project examines rates of depression worldwide, looking at which countries have the highest rates of depression.
The analysis also looks at comparisons between depression and suicide rates, to determine whether one is useful in predicting the other.

The analysis uses Kaggle data set entitled <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/muhammadfaizan65/mental-health-depression-disorder-data">Mental Health Depression Disorder Data</a>
This data provides information on the prevalence of depression and other mental health disorders across the world. It examines depression rates by age, level of education, and gender.
According to the contributor, this data comes from international health organizations and health data sources, including the World Health Organization (WHO) and Global Health Data Exchange (GHDx). 
The data underwent validation before publication.

Part of this project involved conducting a time series analysis on suicide rates in the United States since 1950.
Although this analysis did not prove valuable to the main narrative, the process is viewable here in the folder marked Scripts. 
The original data is hosted online through the <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK569311/table/ch3.tab9/">National Institutes of Health</a>
